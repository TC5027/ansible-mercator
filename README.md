# ansible-mercator

A script that ensures your Ansible variables are defined where they should be.

Have a look at the examples we have.

```
x:~/Desktop/ansible-mercator$ ./ansible-mercator.sh {inventory} {cartography} 
```

The script relies on [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to ensure reproducibility.
